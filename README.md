# TM-InnerJoin
Extends language combination in SDL Trados Studio by performing an inner JOIN with TMs containing one language pair in common

When working on a file in Trados Studio with the language pair German to French, the plugin can use 2 TMs containing equivalent segments, but in different pairs with one language in common.  For example, German to English and French to English.

Useful when having the same content already published in multiple language pairs, but not necesarily the language pair currently being worked on in Trados Studio.
